# TreeFitting
Fit cylinders and branch points to tree point cloud data

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

- Pymesh: *Not required anymore!* However it reads PLY files faster than the roll-your own method I found, so you can still install it for speed.
https://github.com/PyMesh/PyMesh - Clone the repository and install it with pip. If you're on a setup with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.5,
use `pip3 install . --user` to install it onto Python 3.
- Networkx: `pip3 install networkx`
- Numpy, Pandas: `sudo apt-get install python3-pandas`
- imageio: `pip3 install imageio`
- PyQt5
- PyOpenGL

<h2>How to use</h2>
TBD!
